# The Simplest File Uploader

I created this as the simplest way to transfer files into & out of a virtual
machine with networking but no other way to directly share files through the
hypervisor. (In this case, Windows XP via UTM.) The HTML is also super barebones
because I'm supporting IE8 here, lol!

## Setup

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun serve
```

To develop:

```bash
bun dev
```

<small>This project was created using <code>bun init</code> in bun v1.1.20.

runtime.</small>
